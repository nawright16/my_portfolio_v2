        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.

            You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.
            
            Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him? The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
            
            My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
            
            I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't. What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins.</p>
        <h3>My Projects</h3>

        <h3>Contact Me</h3>
        <p>Phone: (202) 555-1234</p>

	<!-- 
	  Directions:
		1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content.
		2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
		3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
		4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
		5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")
		6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
		7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
		8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
		9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

		BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
		  - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
		  - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).
